# Bruhdit

Bruhdit is an app that allows users to participate in an anonymous online discussion forum! Users can create an account with a username of their choice, giving them the choice of concealing their real names. After signing up, users can edit their profile any time they want and add a custom image. When creating a post, users can write about anything, from giving updates on their lives or sharing their feelings to asking questions or writing anonymous blogs! When creating posts, users can choose to include tags or create their own tag. Users can like and comment on other posts and even like comments other users have made. Users can also message other users directly and view all of their conversations in their inbox. Lastly, users can view an analytics page that provides details about the most active users, the most popular posts, and the most liked comments.
